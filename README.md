# KotlinStateExample
You just got the chance to see several new Kotlin features in action. Generics allow data types to be passed as parameters to classes, enum classes define a limited set of possible values, and data classes help automatically generate some useful methods for classes.

You also saw how to create a singleton objectâ€”which is restricted to one instance, how to make it a companion object of another class, and how to extend existing classes with new get-only properties and new methods. Finally, you saw some examples of how scope functions can provide a simpler syntax when accessing properties and methods.

You'll see these concepts throughout the later units as you learn more about Kotlin, Android development, and Compose. You now have a better understanding of how they work and how they can improve the reusability and readability of your code.
